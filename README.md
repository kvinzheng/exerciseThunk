#### I've provided a half-way solution in this branch:
* Using redux-thunk and redux-promise-middleware actions are now being dispatched to fetch results.
* your task is to wire up the rest of the app to display the results.
* stretch: implement "More"

## Objectives
- Use Redux for state management

## Let's get coding.
Your task is to refactor this app to use redux for state management. This means, you should no longer be using ```setState()``` anywhere.

* We've provided the basic boiler plate for the redux and react redux libraries for you.
* Take some time to understand the changes we've made to accomidite redux. The following folders in the ```src``` folder: ```actions``` and ```reducers```, as well as ```src/index.js```.
* Install redux devtools to see the flow of actions through your app.
* Refactor away.
